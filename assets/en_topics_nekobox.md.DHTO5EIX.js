Before our proxy config connects, it has another task in addition to that. If the config we have in the client uses a domain in its address section instead of an IP, like most configs, then when we want to connect with that config, the client uses this <code>Direct DNS</code> address to find the IP of the domain. First, it converts the domain of the config to an IP and then starts to perform its task, creating a tunnel, encrypting, tlshello, separating paths, and exchanging traffic, etc.</p><ul><li><p><strong>Default:</strong> Usually gets the Android system DNS (like 8.8.8.8 for Google or 1.1.1.1 for Cloudflare).</p></li><li><p><strong>Why is it important?</strong> If your ISP blocks or manipulates DNS, domestic sites won&#39;t load.</p></li><li><p><strong>Recommendation:</strong> In Exclave&#39;s settings, turn off the &quot;Use system DNS as Direct DNS&quot; option and in the box below it that says &quot;Direct DNS&quot;, put <code>tcp://8.8.8.8</code> to always use Google. In Iran, its ipv4 is not filtered and it is fast, and what more could a blind person want from God?</p></li></ul><p>It&#39;s the same for Nekobox, but it doesn&#39;t have that option to turn it on or off. In Nekobox, if you write <code>local</code> in the Direct DNS box, just like that in lowercase, it will use the internal Android DNS, and you can leave it as local or, as explained in the previous paragraph, put <code>8.8.8.8</code> here as well.</p><p>Also, for Direct or Local DNS, you can use a public, neutral, hassle-free, and unfiltered DNS server like Alibaba. In this case, as I said above, you must first turn off the <code>Use system DNS as Direct dns</code> option and then proceed to place your desired server in the box below it.

Having this option on means that it sends your DNS queries (requests to convert a domain to an IP) through the proxy (VPN tunnel) instead of going directly to the direct DNS and in some cases, your location being leaked. It passes through the proxy, which is more secure. In my backups, this option is always on by default.</p><p>How to enable it is similar in both clients.

It&#39;s an anti-leak trick that resolves blocked domains to fake IPs like <code>198.18.0.0/15</code>. Then, the client understands that this IP is fake and sends the traffic to the proxy.

id="tun-implementation-stack" tabindex="-1">TUN Implementation / Stack <a class="header-anchor" href="#tun-implementation-stack" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;TUN Implementation / Stack&quot;">​</a></h2><p>First of all, let&#39;s say what <strong>TUN</strong> is.</p><p>It is a method that VPN clients (like Nekobox, Exclave, Hiddify, Singbox, and many others) use to route your internet traffic through a VPN tunnel. To put it very simply, TUN creates a virtual layer so that it seems like all our phone&#39;s traffic passes through a secure path or tunnel. Now, this <strong>TUN Implementation</strong> (or in some clients, we know it as Stack) specifies how this tunnel should be implemented. Each of these three options (System, gVisor, Mixed) is a different method for managing this tunnel.</p><p><strong>Where do you find it?</strong></p><ul><li><strong>In Nekobox, go to:</strong></li></ul><blockquote><p>Settings &gt; TUN Settings &gt; TUN Implementation.</p></blockquote><ul><li><strong>In Exclave, it&#39;s in:</strong></li></ul><blockquote><p>Settings &gt; TUN Settings &gt; Stack.</p></blockquote><ul><li><strong>In Hiddify, it&#39;s in:</strong></li></ul><blockquote><p>Config options &gt; inbound options &gt; TUN implementation.</p></blockquote><ul><li><strong>Why is it important?</strong> Choosing the right option can make your connection faster, more stable, or more secure. The wrong choice can also cause the internet to be disconnected or slow down.</li></ul><details class="details custom-block"><summary>View Screenshot</summary><br><p align="center"><img src="'+P+'" alt="TUN-Implementation" width="640px"></p></details><br><h3 id="tun-types" tabindex="-1">TUN Types <a class="header-anchor" href="#tun-types" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;TUN Types&quot;">​</a></h3><h4 id="_1-system" tabindex="-1">1. System <a class="header-anchor" href="#_1-system" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;1. System&quot;">​</a></h4><p>This option uses the Android operating system (or the phone&#39;s internal TUN) to manage the VPN tunnel. This means that the client directly uses Android&#39;s own features to route traffic.</p><br><p><strong>Advantages:</strong></p><ul><li><strong>High speed:</strong> Because it uses the operating system directly, it is usually the fastest option.</li><li><strong>Less battery consumption:</strong> It puts less pressure on the phone&#39;s CPU.</li><li><strong>Good compatibility:</strong> It works well with most devices and configs.</li></ul><br><p><strong>Disadvantages:</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Less security:</strong> Because it uses the operating system, it may be more vulnerable to DNS Leak or more advanced filtering.</li><li><strong>Less control:</strong> If your ISP or operating system manipulates the DNS, problems such as websites not loading may occur.</li></ul><br><p><strong>When to use it?</strong></p><ul><li>If you are looking for speed and stability and security is not very critical for you (for example, for gaming or streaming), System is a good option.</li><li>Also, if your device is old or has weak hardware, this option works better.</li></ul><br><h4 id="_2-gvisor" tabindex="-1">2. gVisor <a class="header-anchor" href="#_2-gvisor" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;2. gVisor&quot;">​</a></h4><p><strong>gVisor</strong> is a technology created by Google to create an isolated and secure environment for running network code. In this mode, instead of using the operating system&#39;s TUN, it creates a separate virtual layer (like a lightweight virtual machine) that manages the traffic.</p><br><p><strong>Advantages:</strong></p><ul><li><strong>High security:</strong> Because the traffic is processed in an isolated environment, the probability of DNS Leak or information leakage is very low.</li><li><strong>Support for complex settings:</strong> It works better for special configs (such as VLESS or Trojan with advanced settings).</li><li><strong>Resistance to filtering:</strong> In Iran, where DNS and protocol filtering is high, gVisor can perform better.</li></ul><br><p><strong>Disadvantages:</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Slower speed:</strong> Because it has an extra layer, it may be slightly slower than System.</li><li><strong>More battery consumption:</strong> Processing in the gVisor environment puts more pressure on the processor (CPU).</li><li><strong>Potential problems:</strong> On some old devices or those with low RAM, it may cause crashes or connection drops.</li></ul><br><p><strong>When to use it?</strong></p><ul><li>If security is a priority for you (for example, to bypass strict filtering or prevent DNS Leak), gVisor is the best choice.</li><li>Especially if you use complex configs or personal servers.</li></ul><br><h4 id="_3-mixed" tabindex="-1">3. Mixed <a class="header-anchor" href="#_3-mixed" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;3. Mixed&quot;">​</a></h4><p>This option is a hybrid mode that tries to combine the advantages of System and gVisor. In this mode, the client switches between System and gVisor depending on the type of traffic or settings.</p><br><p><strong>Advantages:</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Balance between speed and security:</strong> It uses gVisor for sensitive traffic (such as filtered sites) and System for the rest.</li><li><strong>Flexibility:</strong> If you are not sure which option is better, Mixed is a middle choice.</li></ul><br><p><strong>Disadvantages:</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Complexity:</strong> Because it switches between two modes, it may be unstable in some cases or not recognize the settings correctly.</li><li><strong>Need for testing:</strong> You have to see if it works well with your configs and device or not.</li></ul><br><p><strong>When to use it?</strong></p><ul><li>If you don&#39;t know which option is better or you have a variety of configs (for example, you have both simple vless and advanced reality or hysteria), Mixed can be a good starting point.</li></ul><h3 id="which-one-should-we-choose" tabindex="-1">Which one should we choose? <a class="header-anchor" href="#which-one-should-we-choose" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Which one should we choose?&quot;">​</a></h3><p>For most users in Iran, I have these suggestions:</p><ol><li><p><strong>If you are a beginner or your device is old:</strong> Start with <strong>System</strong>.
