# Difference Between arm64-v8a, armeabi-v7a, and X86 in Android

Some apps are released as **`Universal`**, meaning they run on every type of CPU.  
But many apps are built separately for different **CPU architectures**, such as:

- **`arm64-v8a – arm64 – aarch64`** → modern ARM 64-bit processors  
- **`armeabi-v7a – arm – aarch`** → older ARM 32-bit processors  
- **`x86`** → for Intel 32-bit devices (almost extinct)  
- **`x86_64`** → for Intel 64-bit devices (basically 🦖)  

## Key differences

### armeabi-v7a <Badge type="tip" text="32bit" />
- Runs only on 32-bit CPUs  
- RAM usage limited to around 3~4 GB  
- Slower compared to 64-bit versions  

### arm64-v8a <Badge type="tip" text="64bit" />
- More complete and faster  
- Can run both 64-bit and 32-bit apps  
- Access to 4GB and higher RAM and better performance  
- Almost all devices from the last 5 years are this architecture  

### x86 and x86_64
- For Intel-based processors  
- Belong to the 🦖 dinosaur era of phones/tablets  
- Thankfully, extinct now


## Cross-installation

### On an arm64-v8a phone <Badge type="tip" text="64bit" />
- Can install **arm64-v8a** (recommended, optimized)  
- Can also run **armeabi-v7a**, just slightly slower  

### On an armeabi-v7a phone <Badge type="tip" text="32bit" />
- Cannot install **arm64-v8a** apps  
- Cannot install **x86** versions either  

### Universal version
- Includes all libraries (arm64, armeabi, x86, x86_64)  
- But file size is larger, takes longer to download, and uses more storage  

::: tip Suggestion

If your phone is `arm64-v8a` or `armeabi-v7a`, why bother downloading a **Universal** version which is twice as heavy and contains even **x86** libraries that you’ll never use?  
Check your CPU architecture [here](#check) once, and always download only the optimized version.

:::

## Performance impact
- **If your phone is 64-bit, but you install the 32-bit version:**  
- The app will **run**, ✔️  
- But performance is reduced (10–30% slower in games or heavy processing).  
- RAM usage is capped at 4GB.  
- Less secure than the 64-bit version.  

##  How to check your phone’s CPU architecture {#check}

### 1. From inside Telegram
   Open Telegram → go to `Settings` → scroll to the bottom → you can see the CPU architecture listed (marked in this screenshot):

### 2. Using helper apps
   - [CPU-Z]  
   - [CPU-X]  
   - [Device Checker]  

   In the `SYSTEM` tab, look for the field `Kernel Architecture`.

</p><br/>

### 3. With Termux
   Run this command in Termux to display the primary CPU ABI:  

```bash
getprop ro.product.cpu.abi
```

   Or for more details, run:  

```bash
getprop | grep abi
```

## Compatibility table

| CPU Architecture     | Compatible Installs 🟢 | Incompatible Installs 🔴 |
|:--------------------:|:----------------------:|:-----------------------:|
| armeabi-v7a (32bit)  | armeabi-v7a 🟢         | arm64-v8a 🔴 <br/> x86 🔴 <br/> x86_64 🔴 |
| arm64-v8a (64bit)    | arm64-v8a 🟢 <br/> armeabi-v7a 🟢 | x86 🔴 <br/> x86_64 🔴 |
| x86 (32bit Intel)    | x86 🟢                 | others 🔴 |
| x86_64 (64bit Intel) | x86_64 🟢 <br/> x86 🟢 | others 🔴 |

<br/> 

### Conclusion

- **Old phones** <Badge type="danger" text="32bit" /> → Only use `armeabi-v7a`  
- **Modern phones** <Badge type="danger" text="64bit" /> → Prefer `arm64-v8a` (fallback to armeabi-v7a if needed)  
- **Universal version** → Mostly useless, just wastes download size + storage
