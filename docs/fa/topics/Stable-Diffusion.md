# Stable Diffusion

> Stable Diffusion is a neural network that generates images from a text prompt.

Welcome! Today, we‚Äôll journey from the simplest generations to the most elegant ones, and I‚Äôll provide examples along the way.

Before we begin, I‚Äôd like to mention that AI models are excellent at generating various types of content: girls, cities, guys, nature. However, we‚Äôll focus on cats and something unusual to showcase the full potential! You can experiment on your own after reading this guide :)

**I recommend three bots for use,** but I will only explain the first one in detail, as the other two are quite similar:

1. [StableDiffusion_robot]
2. [stable_diffusion_bot]
3. [StableDiffusionWrapperBot]

## First Steps

Let‚Äôs start with the basics. We‚Äôve just entered the bot and want to generate, say, a frog in a pink spacesuit. So, we‚Äôll write:


<p align="center">
  <img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5958bdd9-ad29-49b5-a170-d5bb6c35c956" alt="Example 1" width="580px" />
</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">
  Frog in a pink spacesuit on the moon </p>


You‚Äôll notice that it doesn‚Äôt matter whether you use Russian or English for the bot, so for clarity, I‚Äôll use English in the following examples.

## Upscale Function

Want to improve the quality of your image? Click the **Upscale** button under the art, and you‚Äôll get a high-resolution PNG image.

## Advanced Input: Weighted Tags

Let‚Äôs learn how to adjust the **weights** of tag-words.

<p align="center">
  <img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0fc8cdba-61d2-48d7-a99a-33298066556c" alt="Example-for-Cat1" width="580px" />
</p>

> **a cat**, (jumping:0.5), (flowers at the background:1.5), **close up**

<p align="center">
  <img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/bb5ce6d4-76ac-46b8-a2ef-7275649ec7fa" alt="Example-for-Cat2" width="580px" />
</p>

> **a cat**, (jumping:1.5), (flowers at the background:0.5), **close up**

You can see how adjusting weights changes emphasis.  
By default, weight is `1.0`. Use values between **0.5** and **1.6** to avoid distortion.


::: tip Only round brackets support manual weights

Square brackets just reduce weight by ~10 present

- `(flowers in the background)` ‚Üí 1.1 weight  
- `((flowers in the background))` ‚Üí ~1.21 weight  
- You can also do: `(flowers in the background:1.4)`  
- To **decrease**, use: `[flowers in the background]` or `(flowers:0.7)`

::: info Characters

We‚Äôve compiled a huge list of character descriptions.  
You can find the tags you need or just write the character‚Äôs name in Russian‚Äîthe bot will suggest tags!

::: info Interesting Tags
