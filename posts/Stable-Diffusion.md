# Stable Diffusion

> Stable Diffusion is a neural network that generates images from a text prompt

Welcome! Today, we’ll journey from the simplest generations to the most elegant ones, and I’ll provide examples along the way.

Before we begin, I’d like to mention that AI models are excellent at generating various types of content: girls, cities, guys, nature. However, we’ll focus on cats and something unusual to showcase the full potential! You can experiment on your own after reading this guide :)

**I recommend three bots for use,**  
but I will only explain the first one in detail, as the other two are quite similar to each other.

1. **[StableDiffusion_robot]**
2. **[stable_diffusion_bot]**
3. **[StableDiffusionWrapperBot]**

<br/>

### First Steps

Let’s start with the basics. We’ve just entered the bot and want to generate, say, a frog in a pink spacesuit. So, we’ll write:

<p align="center">
<img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5958bdd9-ad29-49b5-a170-d5bb6c35c956" alt="BBBB" width="480px"></p><br/>

> Frog in a pink spacesuit on the moon

You’ll notice that it doesn’t matter whether you use Russian or English for the bot, so for clarity, I’ll use English in the following examples:

### Upscale Function

Want to improve the quality of your image? Click the "Upscale" button under the art, and you’ll get a high-resolution PNG image.

<p align="center">
<img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5b09e183-4bf1-4605-adb6-f0299bf297b7" alt="BBBB" width="480px"></p><br/>

<p align="center">
<img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/bf866f8b-bddd-41dc-973d-65121758afa9" alt="BBBB" width="480px"></p><br/>

<hr/><br/>

### Main Bot Functionality

Access the settings via the `/menu` command or by clicking the ⚙️ Menu button available under each generation.

:::tip

- **📐 Format** – The aspect ratio of your generation. The image can be horizontal (for landscapes), vertical (for portraits), or square.
- **📺 Model** – The foundation of your generation, determining the style. All models lean towards realism but retain their unique flair. Try them out and find your favorite! ❤️
- **🎨 Style** – Easily customize your generation. Be sure to try each one. Examples of all styles are available in the bot!

<br/>

:::info Model

The bot contains 4 different models: SD 1.5, SDXL 1, SDXL turbo X2.
You get 8 free generations every day.
:::

::: Info How to Earn Generations?

We provide you with several free generations daily. If you run out, here’s how to get more:
:::

:::info Referral System

In the ⚙️ Menu, select ✨ Invite a Friend and get your unique referral link in the format:  
[https://t.me/StableDiffusion_robot/?start=]

For every person who clicks your link and creates art, you’ll earn 10 generations! For example, you can write an article about the bot on Pikabu and include your referral link, or share it in a chat with friends.
:::

:::warning Shop

Find 🚀 Shop in the menu and purchase additional generations! Developing and maintaining each model costs us a lot, so we’d appreciate your financial support.

If you purchase a Premium subscription, you’ll be able to create 18+ art!
:::

::: info Generation Contest

When you upscale a generation, a 🏆 Submit to Contest button will appear.

### Advanced Input

Let’s learn how to adjust the weights of tag-words. Here’s an example to illustrate this concept:

<p align="center">
<img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0fc8cdba-61d2-48d7-a99a-33298066556c" alt="BBBB" width="480px"></p><br><br/>

> **a cat**, (jumping:0.5), (flowers at the background:1.5), **close up**

And the second version:

<p align="center">
<img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/bb5ce6d4-76ac-46b8-a2ef-7275649ec7fa" alt="BBBB" width="480px"></p><br><br/>

> **a cat**, (jumping:1.5), (flowers at the background:0.5), **close up**

As you can see, the number of flowers and the cat’s pose change within the same prompt.

In the first art, we asked the bot to create a cat with flowers in the background, slightly emphasizing them, while downplaying the cat’s pose.

In the second art, we increased the emphasis on the "jump" and reduced the "flowers in the background." By default, each element has a weight of 1.0. We adjusted the weight from 0.5 to 1.5. It’s recommended not to overuse this, as it can distort the result. A good rule of thumb is to keep values between 0.5 and 1.6. Also, avoid applying this technique to all tags at once, as it can easily ruin the image.

::: tip

- **(flowers in the background)** – Increases the weight from 1.0 to 1.1.
- **((flowers in the background))** – Increases the weight from 1.0 to 1.21.
- You can manually set the value: **(flowers in the background:<value>)**
- **[flowers in the background]** – Decreases the weight from 1.0 to 0.9.

You can only manually decrease the weight using round brackets. For example, you can’t write [orange ears:0.4], only (orange ears:0.4).

👍 That’s it! Mastering this technique opens up many more possibilities for refining results and fixing flaws. Practice on your own to see how it can enhance your favorite art.

::: info Characters

We’ve compiled a huge list of character descriptions. Check it out to find the tags you need, or simply write the character’s name in Russian, and the bot will provide the relevant tags.
