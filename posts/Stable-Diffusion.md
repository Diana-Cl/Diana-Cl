# Stable Diffusion  

Stable Diffusion is a neural network that generates images from a text prompt

Welcome! Today, we’ll journey from the simplest generations to the most elegant ones, and I’ll provide examples along the way.

Before we begin, I’d like to mention that AI models are excellent at generating various types of content: girls, cities, guys, nature. However, we’ll focus on cats and something unusual to showcase the full potential! You can experiment on your own after reading this guide

**I recommend three bots for use,**   
but I will only explain the first one in detail, as the other two are quite similar to each other.

2. **[stable_diffusion_bot]**
3. **[StableDiffusionWrapperBot]**
