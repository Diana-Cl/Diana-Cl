# Stable Diffusion

> Stable Diffusion is a neural network that generates images from a text prompt.

Welcome! Today, we’ll journey from the simplest generations to the most elegant ones, and I’ll provide examples along the way.

Before we begin, I’d like to mention that AI models are excellent at generating various types of content: girls, cities, guys, nature. However, we’ll focus on cats and something unusual to showcase the full potential! You can experiment on your own after reading this guide :)

**I recommend three bots for use,** but I will only explain the first one in detail, as the other two are quite similar:

1. [StableDiffusion_robot]
2. [stable_diffusion_bot]
3. [StableDiffusionWrapperBot]

---

## First Steps

Let’s start with the basics. We’ve just entered the bot and want to generate, say, a frog in a pink spacesuit. So, we’ll write:

<p align="center">
  <img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5958bdd9-ad29-49b5-a170-d5bb6c35c956" alt="Example 1" width="480px" />
</p>> Frog in a pink spacesuit on the moon <br/>  


You’ll notice that it doesn’t matter whether you use Russian or English for the bot, so for clarity, I’ll use English in the following examples.

## Upscale Function

## Advanced Input: Weighted Tags

Let’s learn how to adjust the **weights** of tag-words.

![Cat Example 1](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0fc8cdba-61d2-48d7-a99a-33298066556c)

> **a cat**, (jumping:0.5), (flowers at the background:1.5), **close up**


![Cat Example 2](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/bb5ce6d4-76ac-46b8-a2ef-7275649ec7fa)  

> **a cat**, (jumping:1.5), (flowers at the background:0.5), **close up**


You can see how adjusting weights changes emphasis.  
By default, weight is `1.0`. Use values between **0.5** and **1.6** to avoid distortion.


::: tip❗Only round brackets support manual weights7

Square brackets just reduce weight by ~10%.

- `(flowers in the background)` → 1.1 weight  
- `((flowers in the background))` → ~1.21 weight  
- You can also do: `(flowers in the background:1.4)`  
- To **decrease**, use: `[flowers in the background]` or `(flowers:0.7)`

::: info Characters

We’ve compiled a huge list of character descriptions.  
You can find the tags you need or just write the character’s name in Russian—the bot will suggest tags!
